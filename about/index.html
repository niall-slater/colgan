<p>Stevyn Colgan is an author, artist, former police officer and oddly spelled Cornishman. He is the author of eight books and a popular speaker at UK and international events such as TED, QEDcon, Nudgestock, the Ig Nobel Prizes, Latitude, the Hay Festival of Literature and the Arts, the Edinburgh Fringe and many more. He has appeared on numerous podcasts and radio shows including Freakonomics, Saturday Live, Do The Right Thing, Ex Libris, No Such Thing As A Fish, Little Atoms and Josie Long’s Short Cuts. For more than a decade he was one of the ‘elves’ that research and write the multi award-winning TV series QI and he was part of the writing team that won the Rose D’Or for BBC Radio 4’s The Museum of Curiosity. He now lives a feral existence foraging for food in woodlands around the Buckinghamshire/Oxfordshire border and wishing that he hadn’t eaten all those missing ramblers.</p>
